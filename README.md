# Atharo

Open source extensible AI platform, build on ChatGPT.

## What is this?

Atharo is a platform and AI interface which can be easily extended with deployable, serverless plugins.

A plugin can be any functionality including third-party integrations. Anyone using Atharo can easily "enable" these from a central marketplace, thus quickly extending Chat functionality. 

For more info about building and deploying plugins, check out the [CLI](https://github.com/warent/atharo-cli#readme).
